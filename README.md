# Game of Life Golang  
Rules  
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.  
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.  

#### Why?  
Just to learn some more go.


#### Nice to have
some command line visualisation of each generation based off either a random send or the same seed. Just in ASCII.
